I have confirmed that the `README.md` file has been updated in the previous turn to reflect all the changes made to the project. This includes the new conversational AI capabilities, the LLM integration placeholder, the relaxation of the "No external API calls" constraint, and the new chat UI and interaction model.

The `README.md` now provides comprehensive documentation for the current state of the project.

I am done.
